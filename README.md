# S3 Browser

A lightweight, self-hosted web UI to browse and manage an **S3-compatible** bucket via a small Go HTTP proxy.

The server signs S3 requests using AWS Signature V4 and forwards them to your S3 endpoint, while serving a minimal frontend UI.

---

## Features

* Browse bucket content with folders/prefixes
* Preview files in the browser (depending on frontend capabilities)
* Download objects (supports `Range`)
* Upload objects (`PUT`)
* Rename / move files and folders (implemented as copy + delete)
* Delete files and folders (prefix delete)
* JSON endpoints for listing and stats
* Health endpoint (`/healthz`)
* Works with any **S3-compatible** endpoint

---

## Requirements

* An S3-compatible endpoint
* Access key / secret key with permissions on the target bucket
* Docker (recommended) or a Go toolchain (optional)

---

## Configuration

The server is configured via environment variables:

| Variable               | Required | Description                   | Example          |
| ---------------------- | :------: | ----------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `S3_ENDPOINT`          | ✅       | Base URL of the S3 endpoint   | `http://s3:9000` |
| `S3_REGION`            | ✅       | Region used for SigV4 signing | `us-east-1`      |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`     | ✅       | Access key id                 | `AKIA...`        |
| `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` | ✅       | Secret access key             | `...`            |
| `S3_BUCKET`            | ✅       | Bucket name                   | `my-bucket`      |
| `PORT`                 | ❌       | Listen port (default: `8080`) | `8080`           |

---

## Run with Docker

### Build & run

```bash
docker build -t s3-browser .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e S3_ENDPOINT="http://YOUR_S3_ENDPOINT:9000" \
  -e S3_REGION="us-east-1" \
  -e S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID="YOUR_KEY_ID" \
  -e S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="YOUR_KEY_SECRET" \
  -e S3_BUCKET="my-bucket" \
  s3-browser
```

Open: `http://localhost:8080/`

## API

### Frontend API Endpoints

The web UI uses these JSON endpoints:

* `GET /api/list?prefix=...&delimiter=/&max=...&continuationToken=...`
  Returns a paginated list of objects and common prefixes (folders) under the given prefix.
* `GET /api/stats?prefix=...`
  Returns statistics (total size and count) for objects under the given prefix.
* `POST /api/rename`
  Renames (moves) an object or prefix to a new key.
  Request body: `{"oldKey":"...","newKey":"..."}`
* `POST /api/delete-prefix`
  Deletes an object or all objects under a prefix.
  Request body: `{"prefix":"..."}`

### S3 Proxy Endpoints

The server acts as a transparent proxy to the configured S3 endpoint. All requests to `/s3*` are forwarded with AWS Signature V4.

* `GET|HEAD /s3`
  Lists the bucket (returns raw S3 XML `ListBucketResult`).
  Query parameters: `prefix`, `delimiter`, `max-keys`, `continuation-token`, etc.
* `GET|HEAD /s3/<key>`
  Retrieves an object. Supports `Range` headers for partial downloads.
* `PUT /s3/<key>`
  Uploads an object. The request body is streamed directly to S3.
* `DELETE /s3/<key>`
  Deletes an object.

These endpoints preserve S3 semantics and headers (ETag, Content‑Type, Content‑Length, etc.).

### Health Check

* `GET /healthz`
  Returns `200 OK` if the server can reach the configured S3 endpoint.

### CORS

The server sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` and appropriate CORS headers for all endpoints.
Preflight requests (`OPTIONS`) are supported for all methods.

## Releases

Binary releases are published in GitHub Releases.

Each release provides binaries for:

* Linux (amd64, arm64)
* macOS (amd64, arm64)
* Windows (amd64, arm64)

## Development

### Project Layout

```text
src/
  main.go          # main server entry point
  go.mod           # Go module definition
  public/          # frontend static assets (HTML, CSS, JS)
  .goreleaser.yaml # release configuration
test/
  docker-compose.yaml # local S3 stack with Garage
  garage/          # Garage S3 server setup
  Dockerfile       # test environment image
.github/workflows/
  release.yaml     # CI/CD for releases
```

### Run Locally (Requires Go)

```bash
cd src
go run .
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:8080` (or the port defined by `PORT` environment variable).

### Build Binary

To build a standalone binary:

```bash
cd src
go build -o s3-browser .
```

The binary includes embedded frontend assets.

### Release with GoReleaser

The project uses [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com) for creating cross‑platform releases. Configuration is in `src/.goreleaser.yaml`.

To create a release locally (requires GoReleaser installed):

```bash
cd src
goreleaser release --snapshot --clean
```

CI automatically builds and publishes releases when a Git tag `v*` is pushed.

---

## Tests (local stack)

A local testing stack is available under `test/` and uses **Garage** as an S3-compatible backend.

From the repository root:

```bash
cd test
docker compose up --build
```

Then open: `http://localhost:8080/`

---

## Security notes

* The server signs requests using your credentials: keep them secret.
* If exposed publicly, run behind a reverse proxy with authentication.
* CORS is enabled (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`) for simplicity.
